# Face-Recognition-And-Identification

This is done using Open CV and Python.

Install OpenCV by:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-opencv
```

You need to install numpy and opencv-contrib-python package by:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
**Please install opencv-contrib-python package instead of opencv-contrib as it contains the main modules and also contrib modules.**
**And these are commands required for installation process in ubuntu or linux systems**

In this project you will be testing the face-recognition and identification on basis of live-cam, so just like any other the major requirement is:
**The accuracy and perfection in output is given... if the provided data is accurate enough and better if there are more no.of photos.**

The more the number of photos and more the accuracy of the data.. then we can train the data to match with the current picture from the cam
to give an accurate result.

- Place some test images in the image folder under respective folders.
- Run the faces-train.py script to train with the given images.
- Run the faces.py script to run open cv and live cam to detect the person.
- As shown face-labels.pickle and recognizers are stored in thier respective folder.

Similarly the scripts for color filters and some other fun filters are given.

**More the accuracy of data given... More accurate result is given...**
